In this task I did my-cat, my-grep and my-zip and my-unzip Unix utilities. Kasper did other functionalities like unixshell we also together checked when problems arose 
and figured them out together.
Every file has basic headers
For pictures check Documentation.docx file.

usage is normal andas instructed to all utilies for example my-cat: gcc -o my-cat my-cat.c -Wall -Werror
then run program with wanted args like: ./my-cat main.c
My-cat:
    - First we take args from commandline and make variables for program
   
    -   Opening the given file in read mode also doing check if file opening failed and resulted into a error
    -   Then we read lines to a buffer and print the lines out to the user

my-grep:
    - First we do basic checking for args if they are given or not 
    - If search term is not given print whole file contents 
    -Read line from stdin and check if line includes search term
    - After this we do normal checking if string includes wanted substringg with strstr and if this is true then print the file with wanted term
    - If multiple files are given loop through args and do normal grepping as many times as there are files given

   

My-zip/my-unzip:
    Zip:
        - If no file is given for zipping print instructions on program usage
        - Run program as many times as there are given files.
        - Open a file to read and then get characters of a file
        - then if character that is now read is same as earlier character make count go up by one
        - then if character is not the same anymore, write 4 - byte integer and character to the file 
        - Also write after loop the last values of the variables to the file since otherwise the last values would not be written

    Unzip:
        - Check if file to unzip given
        - Open file to read and do normal error checking for file opening
        - Read characters and and print as many characters as the count says
        - If zipped file consists of multiple files the information of that there were multiple files is lost and
